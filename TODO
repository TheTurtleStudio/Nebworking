NO 1. serverTCP needs a way to terminate clients on command. Terminating clients should send a TERMINATE packet before termination to notify client

NO 2. When creating multiple instances of clientTCP connected to the same serverTCP, the first instance of clientTCP locks the main thread for some reason.

NO 4. packets.AddressType.ALL() does not include the server and neither does packets.AddressType.OTHERS().
