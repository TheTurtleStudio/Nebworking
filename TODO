serverTCP needs a way to terminate clients on command. Terminating clients should send a TERMINATE packet before termination to notify client

serverTCP needs to be able to take a packet, check desinationAddress and do the following: keep packet if packet intended for server, put in NOTIFICATIONS. Forward packet to intended client if not intended for server, put a RELAY packet in NOTIFICATIONS containing packet as element

When creating multiple instances of clientTCP connected to the same serverTCP, the first instance of clientTCP locks the main thread for some reason.

Need RELAY packet constructor in packets.py
