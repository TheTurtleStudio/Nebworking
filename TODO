serverTCP needs a way to terminate clients on command. Terminating clients should send a TERMINATE packet before termination to notify client. 

packets.AddressType.ALL() does not include the server and neither does packets.AddressType.OTHERS(), decide if we want to keep this functionality.

waitForConnectionPacket goes through, getting notifications out of the NOTIFICATION queue, checking if its a connect packet, and then putting it at the back of the queue, putting the queue in reverse order. Look for a way to just peek at the queue, without modifying it, and checking for connection packets. DO NOT MODIFY QUEUE

error handling

MAYBE: add server blockRelay argument to block clients sending other clients packets.
